This is the 1st project as part of Udacity Frontend Nanodegree 2020. It is about creating a static web template for a simple Blog site. It consists of a blog home page and a blog details page along with navigation bar and a footer

This project required to utilize HTML and CSS skills to build out a personal blog website, including custom images, layout, and styling. Along with webpage design considerations, and appropriately structure files, as well as use proper CSS and HTML formatting & style.

# Project Files
In this project, developed is done from scratch! To complete the project, I was required to decide on the HTML and CSS files to include as part of my work, given that the end result is within the confines of the project rubric provided. This should include, at minimum, HTML files related to:

- the blog website
- a blog post

# Skills used
- CSS is built from scratch without any framework such as bootstrap
- Extensive use of Flexbox and Grid
- CSS is moduler using `import` statements
- HTML is developed with proper semantics such as article, header, main, section, aside etc.
- Media queries for responsive web design
